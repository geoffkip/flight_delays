# 2015 Flights exploratory analysis 
# Context
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.
Data can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays.

Some interesting facts
1) Most of the flights (about 17.8%) came from Atlanta International airport.
2) Southwest airlines had the most flights in 2015.
3) January seemed to be the busiest month for flights.
4) Mondays seemed to have the most flights (weird one I thought it would be a weekend day)
5) The month of July had the most departure and arrival delays.
